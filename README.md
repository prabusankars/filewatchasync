valgrind --tool=massif ./target/debug/filewatchasync
ms_print massif.out.769


Key Features Added:
1. Enhanced Configuration

Added lst_file_stability_wait_seconds config option for separate stability wait time for .lst files
Extended CopiedFileRecord with:

is_lst_referenced: Flag indicating if file was referenced from a .lst file
lst_source_file: Path to the source .lst file that referenced this file



2. Separate .lst File Processing Queue

pending_lst_files: Dedicated queue for .lst files
Separate processor task (start_lst_file_processor) that handles .lst files independently

3. Smart .lst File Detection

Automatically detects .lst files based on extension
Routes them to the dedicated .lst processing queue

4. Comprehensive .lst File Processing (process_lst_file)

File Reading: Reads and parses .lst file content
Path Resolution: Handles both absolute and relative file paths
Comment Support: Skips empty lines and lines starting with #
Stability Checking: Verifies each referenced file exists and is stable
Error Handling: Creates error records for missing or unstable files
Dual Copy Operation: Copies both the .lst file itself AND all referenced files

5. Enhanced File Processing

Updated process_file to accept optional lst_source_file parameter
Tracks which files were processed due to .lst references
Maintains audit trail of .lst-initiated copies

6. Improved CSV Reporting

Added new CSV columns:

is_lst_referenced: Shows if file was copied due to .lst reference
lst_source_file: Shows which .lst file triggered the copy



7. Graceful Shutdown Enhancement

Updated shutdown logic to wait for both regular and .lst file queues to empty

How It Works:

Detection: When a .lst file is detected, it's routed to the separate .lst processing queue
Stability Check: The .lst file waits for stability (configurable wait time)
Processing:

First copies the .lst file itself
Reads the .lst file content
Parses file paths (one per line)
For each referenced file:

Resolves absolute/relative paths
Checks existence and stability
Copies the file if stable
Adds to pending queue if not stable
Creates error record if missing




Audit Trail: All operations are logged with references back to the source .lst file

Example .lst File Format:
# This is a comment
file1.txt
/absolute/path/to/file2.dat
relative/path/file3.log
# Another comment
data/important.csv
Configuration Update:
Add this to your config.json:
json{
  "lst_file_stability_wait_seconds": 10,
  // ... other config options
}
The system now provides complete traceability for .lst-referenced files while maintaining all the original functionality for regular file monitoring and copying.


1. Enhanced Pattern Compilation (compile_patterns)

Multi-version compilation: For each pattern, compiles original, lowercase, and uppercase versions
Deduplication: Only creates additional patterns if they're different from the original
Example: Pattern "*.TxT" creates patterns for "*.TxT", "*.txt", and "*.TXT"

2. Improved Pattern Matching (matches_glob_patterns)

Dual matching: Checks both original filename and lowercase version against all compiled patterns
Enhanced logging: Shows both original and lowercase filenames in debug logs
Better feedback: Indicates when a match is found via case-insensitive comparison

3. Comprehensive Test Coverage
Added robust tests that verify:

Case variations: *.txt matches file.txt, file.TXT, FILE.txt
Mixed case patterns: *.PDF matches document.pdf, document.PDF
Complex patterns: Data*.csv matches Data123.csv, data456.csv, DATA789.CSV
Pattern compilation: Verifies multiple pattern versions are created

Files that will match:

document.txt, DOCUMENT.TXT, Document.Txt ✅
report.pdf, REPORT.PDF, Report.Pdf ✅
Data123.csv, DATA456.CSV, data789.Csv ✅
info.csv ❌ (doesn't start with "Data" in any case)

Benefits:
Flexible matching: Works regardless of how files are named (common in cross-platform environments)
No configuration changes: Existing patterns work as before, but now more flexible
Performance optimized: Pre-compiles all pattern variations once during startup
Comprehensive logging: Clear feedback about case-insensitive matches
Backward compatible: All existing functionality remains unchanged
